## Goal
The goal of this project is create a Convolutional Neural Network in python to segment Mars terrain photoes and classify different types of terrain.

## References
This Project is assigned by Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning course at Politecnico di Milano

## Configuration
To train:<br>
Before running the code upload a dataset and change the name from training_set.npz to <your_dataset>.<br>
Then change the names of the labels and the images given for training inside arrays X and y.<br>
Finally run the code.<br>

To predict:<br>
no need to download or upload models or weights, code itself after training execute predictions and evaluations.
